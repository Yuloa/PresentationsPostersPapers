\section{Future work}
The work for the next year includes the following steps
\begin{itemize}
\item update to AlignmentOnline v11 during TS (will take half a day) 
\item plug my code for the monitoring together with the code written by Roel (maybe a couple of days)
\item finish writing the public note about the RICH mirror alignment in Run II 
\item find some plots to show in my thesis about the new RICH mirror alignment to have something to show for 
\item be consultant for Sam working on $c_i$ and $s_i$ measurement
\item get Sam the missing cleo-c data
\item start working on the $\gamma$ measurement at LHCb asap
\end{itemize}
