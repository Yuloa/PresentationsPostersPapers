abstract: the parenthesis in the decay don't make it clear that you are looking for four different decays

include the Feynman diagrams for the weak and strong decays?

line 13: K^0 instead of K^0_S; 
     the theory paper in [8] also speaks of the decay happening via rescattering of K^0_S bar and KPi

line 73: What are the signal regions for N(D(_s)) and N(eta('))

Equation 1: Explain why only the relative efficienies are needed

line 74: clarify more what epsilon actually is (efficiency inside/coutside signal window?)

line 104: does the BDT training window move with the optimisation of the 3pi signal mass window?

Figure 1: show different bkg components, maybe log-plot

line 127: clarify "imperfections"

line 135, 136: K^0_S and rho should have their tail in the eta mass-window and should be parametrised (K^0_S by BW + Gaussian, rho by non-relativistic BW), the non-resonant component could then be linear
     	       the f_0 lies in the eta' window and should be parametrised as well ()

line 147: compare K_S->PiPi MC to K_S->PiPi data instead of eta->PiPi MC to K_S->PiPi data(?)

line 149: what is the systematic uncertainty on the signal yield?

lines 157-160: what does that even mean?

lines 160-162: where do the 2% come from?
