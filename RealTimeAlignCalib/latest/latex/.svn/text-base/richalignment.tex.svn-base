\subsection{Rich Mirror Alignment}
\textcolor{red}{This should include, description of the method (detector description
should be included in previous section), data selected, time required 
for this task, performance (before/after alignment) and stability of the constants. 
The overall performance, maybe also stability of the overall performance (PID 
or/and cherenkov angle resolution) could be together for calibration and alignment.}

Both RICH detectors have two sets of mirrors: photons are reflected off a
primary mirror onto a secondary mirror, from where they are deflected out of the
LHCb acceptance onto the photon detection plane.
%The RICH1/RICH2 optical system consists of 4/56 primary and 16/40 secondary mirrors.

The RICH mirror alignment follows the same general procedure of the tracking
alignment: there is a task performed in parallel by the analysers while the
computation of the alignment constants is performed by the iterator on a single
node. The RICH mirror alignment relies on the fact that a misalignment of the
mirrors causes the Cherenkov ring on the photodetector plane to be shifted with
respect to its expected position. The projected track coordinate is not at the
centre of the ring, thus the Cherenkov opening angle ($\Theta$) varies as a
function of the azimuthal angle ($\phi$) in the photodetector plane:
\begin{equation}
\Delta\Theta = \Theta - \Theta_0 = T_x \cos(\phi) + T_y \sin(\phi),
\label{eq:RichMirror}
\end{equation}
where $T_x$ and $T_y$ are the
% misalignments along the $x$
%  and $y$ direction
components of the misalignment of the projected track coordinate with respect to
the expected position and $\Theta_0$ is the Cherenkov angle calculated from the
momentum of the track and the refractive index of the radiator
\cite{LHCb-DP-2012-003}.

The analysers perform the photon reconstruction and fill histograms of the
$\Delta\Theta(\phi)$ distribution for each pair of mirrors on different events.
The iterator collects all the histograms and combines them. It fits the combined
histogram using Equation (\ref{eq:RichMirror}) and extracts the alignment
constants. The procedure is iterated until the variations are below a
threshold. Figure \ref{fig:RichMirror} shows for one mirror the distribution of
$\Delta\Theta$ as a function of $\phi$ before and after the mirror alignment.
