\section{Scheduling}
\textcolor{red}{ Give an overview of the scheduling for all the tasks: at beginning of each fill? each 1 week?
when we update constants/hv/ if trigger run change. Some details could/should included in each section but probably it would be good to have some `overview' of the schedule.}
